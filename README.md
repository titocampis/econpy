## 0. Introduction
Welcome to EconPy, your one-stop repository for Python scripts designed to make complex economic calculations a breeze. Dive into the world of investments, loans, and financial planning with our easy-to-use scripts.

## 1. Loan Calculator
Tool to calculate all the useful information for the borrower regarding to a Loan. The *Quota*, *Interest*, *Amortization*, etc. Based on **Loan Amortization** method, explained in [theory/economy.pdf](theory/economy.pdf)

#### Configuration
Configurable Parameters:
| Parameter | Explanation                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **principal (int)** | ammount of money borrowed |
| **period (str)** | type of period (month, years) |
| **N (int)** | total number of periods |
| **r (float)** | annual interest rate (in %) |
| **want_csv (bool)** | to export results into a CSV |
| **CSV_FILE (str)** | name of the .csv file |
| **plot (bool)** | plot results |

#### Execution
```bash
python3 main_loan.py
```

## 2. Interest Total Calculator
Tool to study how the *Interest Total* changes depending on the number of periods (in this case, years).

#### Configuration
Configurable Parameters:
| Parameter | Explanation                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **principal (int)** | ammount of money borrowed |
| **period (str)** | type of period (month, years) |
| **N_range (list)** | range of N's to study |
| **r (float)** | annual interest rate (in %) |
| **print_data (bool)** | verbose to see data on stdout |
| **plot (bool)** | plot results |
| **plot_data (str)** | show % or â‚¬ on the graphic |


#### Execution
```bash
python3 main_loan_interest_total.py
```

## 3. Compount Interest Calculator (investing monthly)
Tool to calculate all the useful information for investor regarding to an Investment. *Benefits*, *Total Balance*, *Compound Interest*, *Monthly Contributions*, etc. All the formulas used are explained on [theory/economy.pdf](theory/economy.pdf)

#### Configuration
Configurable Parameters:
| Parameter | Explanation                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **principal (int)** | ammount of money borrowed |
| **period (str)** | type of period (month, years) |
| **N (int)** | total number of periods |
| **N (float)** | annual interest rate (in %) |
| **want_csv (bool)** | to export results into a CSV |
| **CSV_FILE (str)** | name of the .csv file |
| **plot (bool)** | plot results |

#### Execution
```bash
python3 main_compound_interest.py
```

## 4. Loan vs Investment in Funds
Are you planning to take out a loan to buy an **investment** and you don't know how many years to? This is your script.

It will calculate which **years** should be better to ask for planning that you are going to **rent** the **investment** and you are going to invest this money in **funds**.

### 4.1 Calculate the Final Balance over loan years
It will calculate the final balance you are going to have in the funds depending on the years you asked for the loan.

#### Configuration
| Parameter | Explanation                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **N_tot (int)** | total number of years |
| **verbose (bool)** | Show data on stdout |
| **to_csv (bool)** | to export results into a CSV |
| **csv_file (str)** | name of the .csv file |
| **plot (bool)** | plot results |
| **loan_principal (int)** | ammount of money borrowed in loan|
| **loan_r (float)** | loan annual interest rate (in %) |
| **loan_N (int)** | loan number of years |
| **rent_expected (float)** | ammount you expected to earn renting the property |
| **fund_init_ammount (float)** | init contribution to the investment |
| **fund_r (float)** | invesment annual interest rate (in %) |

#### Execution
```bash
python3 main_loan_vs_fund.py
```

### 4.2 Completely Balance breakdown for compound interest investing difference between rent and quota
It will completely detail an example of the balance over years when investing the difference between a loan quota and the rent of the property. So you can estimate the benefits depending on the number of years you ask for the morgage.

#### Configuration
| Parameter | Explanation                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| **N_tot (int)** | total number of years |
| **verbose (bool)** | Show data on stdout |
| **wantcsv (bool)** | to export results into a CSV |
| **CSV_FILE (str)** | name of the .csv file |
| **plot (bool)** | plot results |
| **loan_principal (int)** | ammount of money borrowed in loan|
| **loan_r (float)** | loan annual interest rate (in %) |
| **loan_N (int)** | loan number of years |
| **rent_expected (float)** | ammount you expected to earn renting the property |
| **fund_init_ammount (float)** | init contribution to the investment |
| **fund_r (float)** | invesment annual interest rate (in %) |

#### Execution
```bash
python3 main_example_loan_vs_fund.py
```
